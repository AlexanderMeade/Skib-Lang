# Skib-Lang
A superset of lua that uses the Most up to date syntax and coding conventions to both adhear to the newer generation's linguistic needs and not have to program in lua.

The skiblang compiler compiles directly to lua and always both the embeding of lua and other stuff.

#Examples

skibLang comes with a variaity of features such as functions

as an example this is a simple fizzbuzz program in skiblang

#comments and vars

pretty self explainatory here :p

#fizzBuzz and functions!

this program will then compile to inferior lua code:

now you can't have a modern programming langauge without loops so lets put some in our fizzbuzz program

#variable decleration, loops, breaking!

using the "rizz" keyword we can define a local variable in lua terms to act as an iterator for our gyatt(loop) and once our iterator reaches a certain point we can hit the breaks with caseoh.

as a note the "pass" key word is for continue statements ^^

#embeding!

now lets do some advanced skib scripting.

this program uses embeding via the "ohio" keyword to allow for the use of lua in skibLang and with this we can declare a generic function like map to run the fizzbuzz code below.

#pipes!

how ever I'm not quite satisfied yet with the whole look of this so lets use pipes to make this look good.

Now is that not the nicest code you've ever seen.

#modules

now what about modules I hear you cry well you can use the keyword "bussin" to use your favorite modules!

#slotting

now with an important note this will not import your files into skiblang only the slot keyword can also known as the "kaicenat" keyword

![image](https://github.com/AlexanderMeade/Skib-Lang/assets/128431625/3d8aa65f-2425-4fd1-b959-2f0063afaaaf)

with the kaicenat keyword we can slot in the code into our main program!

#namespaceishes

now the big filepath may off put you and with good reason but we can use the namespace keyword "livvy" to keep it short and sweet
